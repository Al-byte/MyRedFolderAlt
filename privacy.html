  <p>We protect your information using some of the most advanced technical and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and top level data encryption protocols, physical access controls to our data centers, and information access authorization controls.</p>
  <p>Note that your login requires a&nbsp;<strong>(1:)</strong>&nbsp;User Name&nbsp;<strong>(2:)</strong>&nbsp;Password&nbsp;<strong>(3:)</strong>&nbsp;4-Digit Security Code. If for any reason these credentials are not input properly the plan owner will receive an email regarding an attempt to access their account. In addition to this added layer of security, you'll immediate notice that once inside your plan, there is another 4-digit security code that must be entered for access in order to view certain aspects of the account. NEPTA recommends that you change your USER NAME and PASSWORD every 6 Months mitigate any potential data breach.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Cloud security at the National Emergency Planning and Training Association is the highest priority. As a MyRedFolder® customer, you will benefit from a data center and network architecture built to meet the requirements of the most security-sensitive organizations.</p>
